## Overview

What Am I Even Doing? is a web app designed to help users plan what to do over the weekend or on any given day. They can comment on different businesses and sort through businesses based on their location and pre-selected categories. The app utilizes Yelp's API.

## Technologies Used
* [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview)

## Approach
I wanted to create an app where users could explore different activities to do in the city based on their location. After looking into the Yelp API, I decided to create predefined queries for users so that I could further customize the application and have a little fun with having simple queries represented by different phrases.

## Unsolved Problems/Next Steps
* Initially when this application was built, a separate database was hosted elsewhere. I want to incorporate my own database so that I can deploy this application and have it accessible to the public.
